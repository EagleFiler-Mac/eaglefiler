## What is EagleFiler?

EagleFiler for Mac is a **digital filing cabinet** that helps you collect, store, and manage information in one place. It goes beyond simple Finder folders by giving you the ability to archive documents, emails, notes, PDFs, web pages, and images into structured libraries. Everything is searchable, taggable, and can be encrypted for extra security.  

Unlike basic storage solutions, EagleFiler is designed to **transform raw data into an organized knowledge system**. You can drop in files from Finder, import messages from Apple Mail, or save research directly from Safari and other browsers. The result is a library where everything is easy to find, annotate, and categorize.  

One of EagleFilerâ€™s most practical uses is **email archiving**. Instead of letting your inbox slow down with years of messages, you can export entire mailboxes into EagleFiler. Messages are fully indexed, searchable, and can be tagged with metadata for quick retrieval. Writers, researchers, and professionals often rely on this feature to keep correspondence and documents together in a single archive.  

The app also excels at **information retrieval**. Its indexing system, combined with Spotlight search, means you can instantly find files using keywords, tags, or custom notes. With multi-tag support and hierarchical organization, EagleFiler is much more powerful than Finder for managing large sets of documents.  

For users who care about **privacy and security**, EagleFiler includes AES-256 encryption, allowing you to protect sensitive libraries such as contracts, financial records, or private research. Unlike cloud-only tools, EagleFiler keeps everything local on your Mac, giving you full control over your data.  

Typical workflows include:  
- Students and academics saving articles, PDFs, and notes for study projects.  
- Professionals managing case files, invoices, and reports in structured libraries.  
- Writers collecting research, drafts, and reference material.  
- Everyday users keeping manuals, recipes, receipts, and personal notes in one place.  

Because it works offline and integrates seamlessly with Time Machine, EagleFiler fits naturally into macOS workflows while remaining flexible enough to sync libraries with iCloud or Dropbox when needed.
